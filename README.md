---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installing Python

Installers available for:

- **Windows**
- **Mac**
- **Linux**

Tools:
- Text Editors: Notepad
- IDEs: Thonny, PyCharm, VS Code

---

## üî§ Python Syntax Overview

- Uses **indentation** for blocks (no `{}` or `;`)
- Case-sensitive
- Commands end with newline, not `;`

### Control Statements:

- `if`, `else`, `elif`
- `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`
- `try`, `except`, `finally`, `raise`
- `class`, `def`, `with`, `pass`, `yield`

### Expressions:

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `**`
- `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- `and`, `or`, `not`
- `is`, `in`
- `lambda`, `x if c else y`
- `@` (matrix multiplication)
- `:=` (walrus operator)

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Identifiers and Variables

- Must start with a letter or `_`
- Can contain letters, digits, `_`
- Case-sensitive (`Age` ‚â† `age`)
- Dynamically typed

# üîÅ Module 2: Conditional Statements and Loops in Python
> Learn how to make decisions and perform repetitive tasks in Python using conditional statements and loops.

---

## ‚úÖ Topics Covered

### üîπ Conditional Statements in Python
- What are Conditional Statements?
- Truthy and Falsy values in Python
- `if` statement
- `if-else` statement
- `if-elif-else` statement
- Nested `if` statements
- Single-line `if` statements

### üîπ Loops in Python
- Sequential execution vs Repetition
- `while` loop
  - Syntax and flow
  - Use of `else` with `while`
- `for` loop
  - Iteration over a sequence
  - Using `range()` with `for`
  - Using `len()` with `for`
  - Use of `else` with `for`
- Nested Loops
- Using `end` in `print()` for formatting loop output

### üîπ Loop Control Statements
- `break`: Exit a loop early
- `continue`: Skip current iteration
- `pass`: Placeholder statement in loops and functions
