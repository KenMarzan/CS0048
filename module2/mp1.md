## Problem Statement

This machine problem aims to create a simple program to manage orders at the "Python Restaurant." Users can select items from a menu, and the program will calculate the total cost of their order. If the total exceeds ₱500, a 10% discount is applied.

### Requirements:
1. Display a menu with predefined items.
2. Allow users to repeatedly select items until they choose to exit.
3. Calculate the total cost and apply discounts if applicable.
4. Do not use arrays, lists, or dictionaries to store the menu items.
5. Use `if-elif` statements to handle menu choices.
